# 13. Explain the array operations of Numpy array.

NumPy arrays (`ndarray`) support a wide variety of operations that are performed in an element-wise fashion. This means that operations are applied to each element in the array, and this process is highly optimized (vectorized) for performance.

## 1. Arithmetic Operations

You can perform standard arithmetic operations between arrays or between an array and a scalar. The operations are applied element by element.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Element-wise addition
print(f"a + b = {a + b}")  # Output: [5 7 9]

# Element-wise subtraction
print(f"b - a = {b - a}")  # Output: [3 3 3]

# Element-wise multiplication
print(f"a * b = {a * b}")  # Output: [ 4 10 18]

# Element-wise division
print(f"b / a = {b / a}")  # Output: [4.  2.5 2. ]

# Operation with a scalar
print(f"a * 2 = {a * 2}")  # Output: [2 4 6]
```

## 2. Universal Functions (ufunc)

NumPy provides many universal functions, which are functions that operate on `ndarrays` in an element-by-element fashion.

```python
arr = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi])

# Trigonometric functions
print(f"sin(arr) = {np.sin(arr)}")

# Exponential and Logarithmic
arr2 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(f"exp(arr2) = {np.exp(arr2)}")
print(f"sqrt(arr2) = {np.sqrt(arr2)}")
```

## 3. Aggregation Functions

These functions perform an operation on an array and return a single value.

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(f"Sum of all elements: {arr.sum()}")       # Output: 21
print(f"Min of all elements: {arr.min()}")       # Output: 1
print(f"Max of all elements: {arr.max()}")       # Output: 6
print(f"Mean of all elements: {arr.mean()}")     # Output: 3.5
print(f"Standard deviation: {arr.std()}")    # Output: 1.707...
```
You can also perform aggregations along a specific axis (e.g., `arr.sum(axis=0)` to sum columns, `arr.sum(axis=1)` to sum rows).

## 4. Comparison Operations

Comparisons are also done element-wise and return a boolean array.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([1, 5, 2, 4])

# Element-wise comparison
print(f"a == b: {a == b}")  # Output: [ True False False  True]
print(f"a > 2: {a > 2}")    # Output: [False False  True  True]
```
Boolean arrays can be used for indexing to select elements that meet a certain condition.
```python
print(f"Elements in a where a > 2: {a[a > 2]}") # Output: [3 4]
```

## 5. Linear Algebra (Dot Product)

While multiplication (`*`) is element-wise, the `@` operator (or `np.dot()`) is used for matrix multiplication (dot product).

```python
mat_a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
mat_b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Element-wise product
print("Element-wise product:\n", mat_a * mat_b)

# Matrix product (dot product)
print("\nMatrix product:\n", mat_a @ mat_b)
```
This is just a subset of the operations available in NumPy, but it covers the most common and fundamental ones used in scientific computing and data analysis.
