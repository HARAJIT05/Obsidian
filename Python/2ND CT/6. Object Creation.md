# 6. Identify the syntax to create an object of class student with the same attribute as simon.

To create a new object of a class with the same attributes as an existing object, you generally have two main approaches:

1.  **Manual Attribute Copying:** Create a new instance and then manually copy the attribute values from the source object.
2.  **Copy Constructor or Method:** Implement a method within the class (often called a "copy constructor" or a `copy` method) that handles the creation of a new object based on an existing one.

Let's assume we have a `Student` class and an existing object named `simon`.

## Example:

First, let's define the `Student` class and create the `simon` object.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):
        self.name = name
        self.student_id = student_id

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student(name='{self.name}', student_id='{self.student_id}')"

# Create the original object
simon = Student('Simon', '12345')
print(f"Original object: {simon}")
```

### Syntax to Create a New Object with Same Attributes

Here is the syntax for creating a new `student` object with the same attributes as `simon`.

```python
# Assuming 'simon' is an existing object of the Student class

# Create a new object by accessing simon's attributes
another_student = Student(simon.name, simon.student_id)

# Now, 'another_student' is a new, independent object with the same data
print(f"Copied object: {another_student}")

# Verify they are different objects in memory
print(f"Are they the same object? {another_student is simon}")
```

This code snippet performs the following actions:
1.  It calls the `Student` class constructor again.
2.  For the `name` argument, it passes `simon.name`.
3.  For the `student_id` argument, it passes `simon.student_id`.

The result is a new `Student` instance, `another_student`, that is a separate object from `simon` but holds the exact same attribute values.
