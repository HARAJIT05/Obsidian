# 12. Difference between Numpy & Pandas.

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) and **Pandas** are both essential libraries in the Python data science ecosystem, but they serve different primary purposes.

The key difference is that **NumPy** is focused on efficient numerical operations on homogeneous multi-dimensional arrays, while **Pandas** is designed for flexible and intuitive manipulation of labeled, heterogeneous tabular data.

In short: **NumPy is for arrays and numbers; Pandas is for tables of data.**

## Detailed Comparison:

| Feature | NumPy | Pandas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Data Structure** | `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) | `DataFrame` (2D table) and `Series` (1D column) |
| **Data Type** | Homogeneous. All elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers or all floats). | Heterogeneous. A DataFrame can have columns with different data types (e.g., integer, float, string, datetime). |
| **Indexing** | Uses integer-based (zero-indexed) indexing. `arr[0]`, `arr[1, 2]`. | Uses label-based (`loc`) and integer-based (`iloc`) indexing. `df['column_name']`, `df.loc[0]`. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Fast mathematical and numerical computations. Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation. The foundation for many other libraries. | Data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and exploration. Reading/writing data from files (CSV, Excel), handling missing values, grouping, merging. |
| **Performance** | Extremely fast for numerical operations as it's written in C. | Built on top of NumPy, so it's very fast. However, the added flexibility and features can introduce some overhead compared to raw NumPy. |
| **Memory Usage** | More memory-efficient for numerical data due to fixed data types. | Less memory-efficient than NumPy because it needs to store data types and labels for each column. |

## Example:

Let's represent the same data in both libraries.

### NumPy Example:
Here, we must use a 2D array. All data will be treated as the same type. If we have strings and numbers, NumPy will upcast everything to a string type, which prevents numerical calculations.

```python
import numpy as np

# NumPy can't easily mix types, so we'll use numbers only
data_np = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]])

# Perform a numerical operation
print("NumPy array + 5:")
print(data_np + 5)
```

### Pandas Example:
Pandas handles mixed data types gracefully in a DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

data_pd = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'Score': [88.5, 92.0, 78.5]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data_pd)

print("Pandas DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Perform a column-specific operation
print("\nAges in 5 years:")
print(df['Age'] + 5)
```

## Conclusion:
You don't usually choose between NumPy and Pandas. You use them together.
- Use **NumPy** when you need to perform fast, complex mathematical functions on arrays of numbers.
- Use **Pandas** as your primary tool for wrangling, cleaning, and analyzing tabular data, as it provides a much more expressive and user-friendly interface for these common tasks.
