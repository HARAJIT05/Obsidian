# 21. Apply the syntax to define the class in python with example.

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It bundles data (attributes) and functions that work on that data (methods) into a single unit.

## Syntax

The syntax for defining a class is straightforward. It uses the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. The body of the class is indented.

```python
class ClassName:
    # <statement-1>
    # .
    # .
    # <statement-N>
```

- **`class ClassName:`**: This is the class header. Class names are conventionally written in `CamelCase`.
- **`__init__()` method**: This is a special method called a "constructor". It is automatically called when you create a new instance (object) of the class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes. The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
- **Attributes**: These are variables that store data. They are defined within the `__init__` method using `self.attribute_name = value`.
- **Methods**: These are functions defined inside a class that operate on the object's attributes. The first parameter of a method is always `self`.

## Example

Here is an example of a `Car` class. It has attributes for `make`, `model`, and `year`, and methods to display its description and calculate its age.

```python
import datetime

# Define the 'Car' class
class Car:
    # The constructor method to initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0  # Default attribute

    # A method to get a formatted description of the car
    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()

    # A method to calculate the car's age
    def calculate_age(self):
        """Calculate the age of the car based on the current year."""
        current_year = datetime.date.today().year
        return current_year - self.year

    def read_odometer(self):
        """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")


# --- Using the Class to Create an Object ---

# Create an instance (object) of the Car class
my_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2020)

# Access attributes and call methods
print(f"My car is an: {my_car.get_descriptive_name()}")
print(f"The car's age is: {my_car.calculate_age()} years.")
my_car.read_odometer()

# You can also access attributes directly
my_car.odometer_reading = 23
my_car.read_odometer()
```

### Output:
```
My car is an: 2020 Audi A4
The car's age is: 5 years.
This car has 0 miles on it.
This car has 23 miles on it.
```
This example shows how the `class` syntax is applied to create a structured and reusable blueprint for `Car` objects.
