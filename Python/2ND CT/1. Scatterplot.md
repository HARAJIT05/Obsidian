# 1. Evaluate the use of scatterplot in data visualization with proper example.

A **scatterplot** is a type of data visualization that displays values for typically two variables for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

## Use Cases:
- **Correlation and Relationship:** Scatterplots are excellent for visualizing the relationship or correlation between two continuous variables. You can easily see if there is a positive correlation, a negative correlation, or no correlation.
- **Cluster Detection:** They can help in identifying clusters or natural groupings of data points.
- **Outlier Detection:** Outliers in the data are often easily identifiable as points that are far away from the main cluster of points.

## Example:
Here is a Python example using `matplotlib` to create a scatterplot. This plot shows the relationship between the 'age' of a car and its 'speed'.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
car_age = [2, 5, 8, 1, 9, 2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 8, 5, 1, 7, 4]
car_speed = [99, 86, 87, 111, 86, 103, 94, 98, 98, 87, 94, 90, 105, 95, 92]

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(car_age, car_speed)

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Car Age vs. Speed')
plt.xlabel('Age of Car (Years)')
plt.ylabel('Maximum Speed (mph)')

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Expected Graph Output:
This code will generate a window displaying a scatterplot. The x-axis will be "Age of Car (Years)" and the y-axis will be "Maximum Speed (mph)". Each point on the plot represents a car, positioned according to its age and speed. You would observe the distribution of points to see if older cars tend to be slower.
