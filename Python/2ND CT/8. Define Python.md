# 8. Define Python with example.

## Definition

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. It is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, which makes debugging easier and development faster.
- **High-Level:** It abstracts away complex details of the computer's hardware. You don't need to worry about memory management.
- **Dynamically-Typed:** You don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is inferred at runtime.
- **Large Standard Library:** Python has a "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with a vast library of modules and functions that you can use out of the box.
- **Readability:** Its syntax is clean and resembles plain English, making it one of the easiest languages for beginners to learn.

## Example

Here is a simple Python program that demonstrates several basic features: variables, a function, a loop, and conditional statements.

The program defines a function `greet_users` that takes a list of names, loops through them, and prints a personalized greeting.

```python
# Define a function that takes a list of names
def greet_users(user_list):
    """This function greets each user in the provided list."""
    for user in user_list:
        if user.lower() == 'admin':
            print(f"Hello {user}, welcome back! Would you like to see a status report?")
        else:
            print(f"Hello {user}, thank you for logging in again.")

# Create a list of users
users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Admin', 'Charlie']

# Call the function with the list of users
greet_users(users)

# Example of dynamic typing
my_variable = 10
print(f"\nMy variable is: {my_variable} (an integer)")

my_variable = "Now I'm a string"
print(f"My variable is: {my_variable} (a string)")
```

### Output of the program:

```
Hello Alice, thank you for logging in again.
Hello Bob, thank you for logging in again.
Hello Admin, welcome back! Would you like to see a status report?
Hello Charlie, thank you for logging in again.

My variable is: 10 (an integer)
My variable is: Now I'm a string (a string)
```
This example showcases Python's clear syntax, dynamic typing, and fundamental programming constructs.
