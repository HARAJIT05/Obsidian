# 2. Evaluate the importance of using the 'with' statement for file handling.

The `with` statement in Python is crucial for proper resource management, especially in file handling. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.

## Importance:
1.  **Automatic Resource Management:** The primary advantage of using `with` is that it ensures the file is closed automatically as soon as the block of code inside the `with` statement is exited. This happens whether the block is exited normally, through an exception, or a `return` statement.
2.  **Cleaner Code:** It eliminates the need for an explicit `try...finally` block to close the file. This makes the code more concise, readable, and less error-prone.
3.  **Exception Safety:** It guarantees that the cleanup code (closing the file) is always executed, even if errors occur during processing. This prevents resource leaks, where a file might remain open, consuming system resources or preventing other programs from accessing it.

## Example:

### Without `with` statement:
You must explicitly close the file, and to do it safely, you need a `try...finally` block.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
try:
    file.write('Hello, World!')
finally:
    file.close() # This must be called to ensure the file is closed.
```

### With `with` statement:
The `with` statement handles everything for you.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!')
# The file is automatically closed here.
```

The second example is clearly more Pythonic, readable, and safer. It reduces boilerplate code and lets the developer focus on the logic of handling the file's content.
