# 18. Difference between the python list and tuples in term of mutability and usage.

The primary difference between Python lists and tuples is **mutability**. Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. This core difference dictates their common usage patterns.

---
## Mutability

### List (Mutable)
A list is created using square brackets `[]`. "Mutable" means that after a list is created, its contents can be changed. You can add, remove, or modify elements.

```python
my_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14]
print(f"Original list: {my_list}")

# Modify an element
my_list[1] = 'world'
print(f"Modified: {my_list}")

# Add an element
my_list.append(True)
print(f"Appended: {my_list}")

# Remove an element
my_list.pop()
print(f"Popped: {my_list}")
```

### Tuple (Immutable)
A tuple is created using parentheses `()`. "Immutable" means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 'hello', 3.14)
print(f"Original tuple: {my_tuple}")

# Attempting to modify an element will raise a TypeError
try:
    my_tuple[1] = 'world'
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"\nError: {e}")
```
To "change" a tuple, you must create a new tuple.

## Usage

This difference in mutability leads to different use cases.

| Aspect | List | Tuple |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **When to Use** | Use for a collection of items that is likely to **change** during the program's execution. For example, a list of users, a to-do list, or a series of numbers you are processing. | Use for a collection of items that should **not change**. Tuples are used to represent fixed collections of data, like coordinates (x, y), RGB color values, or records from a database. |
| **Performance** | Slightly slower than tuples due to the overhead of being mutable. Operations can be less efficient as memory allocation may need to change. | Slightly faster and more memory-efficient than lists. The fixed size allows for some optimizations by the Python interpreter. |
| **Hashability** | Lists are **unhashable**. This means you **cannot** use a list as a key in a dictionary or as an element in a set. | Tuples are **hashable** (as long as they only contain other hashable types). This means you **can** use a tuple as a key in a dictionary. |

### Dictionary Key Example:

```python
# Using a tuple as a dictionary key (VALID)
locations = {
    (35.6895, 139.6917): "Tokyo",
    (40.7128, -74.0060): "New York City"
}
print(f"\nLocation at (35.6895, 139.6917): {locations[(35.6895, 139.6917)]}")

# Using a list as a dictionary key (INVALID - will raise TypeError)
try:
    bad_dict = {
        [35.6895, 139.6917]: "Tokyo"
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error with list key: {e}")
```

## Summary:
- Use a **list** when you need a sequence of items that can be modified.
- Use a **tuple** when you need a sequence of items that should remain constant, or when you need a hashable container (like for a dictionary key).
