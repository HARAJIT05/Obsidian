# 22. Define tuple and give one key difference from list.

## Definition of Tuple

A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python. It is one of Python's built-in sequence data types.

- **Ordered:** The items in a tuple have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- **Immutable:** Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified. You cannot add, remove, or change its elements.
- **Allows Duplicates:** Tuples can contain items with the same value.

Tuples are created by placing a comma-separated sequence of values inside parentheses `()`.

### Example:
```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, "hello")

print(f"My tuple: {my_tuple}")
print(f"Type: {type(my_tuple)}")

# Accessing elements is the same as with lists
print(f"First element: {my_tuple[0]}")
print(f"Last element: {my_tuple[-1]}")
```

## One Key Difference from List

The single most important difference between a tuple and a [[18. List vs Tuple|list]] is **mutability**.

- **Lists are mutable:** You can change a list after it has been created (add, remove, or modify elements).
- **Tuples are immutable:** You **cannot** change a tuple after it has been created.

### Demonstration of the Difference:

#### List (Mutable)
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(f"Original list: {my_list}")
my_list[0] = 99  # This is allowed
my_list.append(4) # This is allowed
print(f"Modified list: {my_list}")
```
*Output:*
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3]
Modified list: [99, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Tuple (Immutable)
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(f"\nOriginal tuple: {my_tuple}")

# Attempting to change the tuple will result in an error.
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 99  # This will raise a TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error when trying to modify tuple: {e}")
```
*Output:*
```
Original tuple: (1, 2, 3)
Error when trying to modify tuple: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
This immutability makes tuples useful for representing fixed collections of data, such as coordinates or database records, and allows them to be used as dictionary keys, whereas lists cannot.
