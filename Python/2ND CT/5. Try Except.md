# 5. Analyse the use of try and except function for using the block in file handling.

The `try...except` block is a fundamental error handling mechanism in Python. In the context of file handling, it is used to gracefully manage potential errors that can occur when you are working with files, such as the file not being found or not having the right permissions.

## Use in File Handling:

When you perform file operations, many things can go wrong:
- `FileNotFoundError`: The file you are trying to read does not exist.
- `PermissionError`: You don't have the necessary permissions to read or write to the file.
- `IOError`: A general input/output error.
- `UnicodeDecodeError`: The file is not in the expected encoding.

The `try...except` block allows you to anticipate these errors and provide a fallback plan instead of letting the program crash.

## Analysis:

- **Robustness:** It makes your program more robust. Instead of terminating unexpectedly, the program can catch the error, log a message, or try an alternative action.
- **Clarity:** It clearly separates the "happy path" (the code in the `try` block) from the error-handling logic (the code in the `except` block).
- **Specificity:** You can catch specific exceptions (like `FileNotFoundError`) and handle them differently from other exceptions. This allows for more fine-grained error handling.

## Example:

Let's try to read a file that may not exist.

### Without `try...except`:
If `non_existent_file.txt` does not exist, this program will crash.

```python
# This will raise FileNotFoundError if the file doesn't exist
file = open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()
print(content)
```

### With `try...except`:
This program will handle the error gracefully.

```python
try:
    # It's best practice to combine with the 'with' statement
    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file was not found.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Error: You do not have permission to read this file.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# The program continues to run after the error.
print("Execution continues...")
```

In this improved example, if the file is not found, a user-friendly message is printed, and the program continues. This is far better than an unhandled exception that crashes the script.
