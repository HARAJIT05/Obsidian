# GEMINI.md - Project Overview

## Directory Overview

This directory is an Obsidian vault used for managing notes for a Database Management System (DBMS) course. It contains notes, questions, and configuration files related to the course content. The vault is structured to support a mind-map-style organization of concepts, primarily using Markdown files with wiki-style links.

## Key Files

*   `INDEX DBMS 2ND CT/Index.md`: This is the main index file for the course notes. It provides links to the notes for different modules.
*   `INDEX DBMS 2ND CT/Module2.md`: This file contains the notes for Module 2, covering topics like relational database integrity, keys, redundancy, normalization, and decomposition.
*   `INDEX DBMS 2ND CT/Module4.md`: This file contains the notes for Module 4, which covers transactions, ACID properties, concurrency control, locking protocols, and deadlocks.
*   `q.txt`: This file contains the original list of questions for Module 2 and Module 4 that were used to generate the notes.
*   `.obsidian/`: This directory contains the configuration files for the Obsidian vault. These files manage plugins, appearance, and workspace settings.
    *   `.obsidian/workspace.json`: This file stores the state of the Obsidian workspace, including open files, pane layout, and other UI settings.
*   `Welcome.md`: The default welcome file for the Obsidian vault.

## Usage

This directory is an Obsidian vault and is intended to be used with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application. To use this vault:

1.  Download and install Obsidian.
2.  Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault".
3.  Navigate to this directory (`E:\Obsidian Files\DBMS 1ST SEM MCA`) and select it.

The vault is structured to be explored as a mind map. You can start with the `INDEX DBMS 2ND CT/Index.md` file and navigate through the notes using the links. The graph view in Obsidian can also be used to visualize the connections between different concepts.
